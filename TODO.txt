1. Reconstruct the split messages - Ron
2. Send appropriate replies for messages received (NR, NS)
3. There was a third point but I don't really remember what it was
4. Write the report


Reconstructing split messages:
	currently adds a '-' to the end of the strings which our clients can look for to check if the message piece it sees is the last one
	problem in that it isn't currently looking for the correct NR, NS, so it doesn't wait to confirm messages are sent/received from the Primary
	when NR/NS is fixed, message construction should work
